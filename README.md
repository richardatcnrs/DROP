All test cases are given in the standard weighted adjacenty format. 
The first line contains an integer n, denoting the number of vertices in the graph.
Followed by an n by n matrix. Entry M_i,j is the weight of the edge going from vertex i to vertex j. Values 0 denotes that there is no edge from vertex i to j.
Set 1 contains selected test cases from the TSPLIB databse (http://comopt.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de/software/TSPLIB95/).
Set 2 test cases are generated by the random graph generator (graph_genenrator_random.py). 
The random graph generator simulate a 'wind-map' within a city block with several buildings in place and the weights are calculated based on the direction/intensity of 
the wind and the distance between the vertices. 

Solvers only accept the test cases after a pre-process is performed (pre_process.py).
